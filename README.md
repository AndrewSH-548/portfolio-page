A compilation of all the highest-effort programs I've created.


## No Signal

- Completed in collaboration with 4 other students. Made using C#'s MonoGame.
- 2D vertically scrolling platformer, featuring a midair height boosting ability with limitations.
- Player stays in the center while all other objects move vertically relative to them. Background is a large singular image that scrolls in the same fashion.
- While ascending, trigger zones cause hazardous objects to fall and potentially KO the player.


## Which Pokemon am I?

- Made in JavaScript.
- Pokemon guessing game. User is given basic information and can click for an extra hint or guess the pokemon's name.
- Uses PokeAPI to retrieve necessary data from the "Pokemon" and "Evolution Chain" JSON files.
- A lot of work to handle special characters in certain pokemon's names and ensure they're easy to type for the user.

## Lola Rides the Wind

- 2D room-based platformer, featuring a slow-falling ability. Made using JavaScript's PixiJS.
- Rooms are classes with lists of the objects they contain, such as terrain, hazards and items.
- Features to ease experience such as informative signs and control options.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            The player will have access to basic horizontal movement and jumping with the primary ability to slow their falling speed in mid-air. They will also be able to use objects in the overworld, such as wind fields, to boost their height and access harder to reach platforms. If possible, extra abilities may be integrated to allow access to initially inaccessible areas.
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop: Arrows, WASD</li>
                <li>Mobile (hypothetical): Left/Right on-screen buttons, Jump/Slow-fall button.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Onboarding</h3>
            The player will be given instructions on the controls from the main menu.
            <h3>Player Learning</h3>
            As abilities are accrued, tougher platforming challenges will be present in later areas that make use of these abilities. The player will need to know the right way to use these abilities for such challenges, sometimes involving a secondary effect of said ability.
